## My process

At first, I wanted to build with `SolidJS`, but a lot of integrations and `@solidjs/testing-library`, `astro` and a bunch of stuff just aren't very compatible with each other. So I decided against it, and converted all SolidJS code to Vue.

### Built with

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.org/)
